# Use dependencies from the NuGet registry to develop .NET applications faster. Learn how to manage dependencies for your project.

</br>INTRODUCTION
</br>When you work on an application, you write code to implement business requirements. For the sake of speed and reliability, you and your team won't write all the code yourselves. You rely on external code: libraries that someone else wrote.

</br>One way to approach building your app with external libraries is to use existing libraries that you can download from and possibly even add to. By using these libraries, you'll be able to finish building your app sooner and take it to market faster than the competition. Another benefit to using libraries might be to ensure that your app follows recommended practices for authentication and authorization. After all, protecting your data and your customers' data is a significant concern.

</br>In this module, you'll use the .NET command-line tool and the NuGet package registry to add libraries to your application code. You'll also be introduced to managing updates and mitigating issues.

</br>SUMMARY
</br>You started by learning how to install dependencies that your app can use. Using dependencies in your application helps you create the application faster because the code is already written. Also, it's a good idea to rely on tried and tested libraries rather than writing something yourself. Using these libraries is an especially good idea when you're adding authentication and authorization to your app.

</br>This module then showed you how to use the .NET CLI to install dependencies locally.

</br>After that, you learned how to update your dependencies. Dependencies are updated for various reasons in the form of bug fixes, new features, or larger changes. In the project file, you can configure the types of updates you're interested in on a per-dependency basis. If you work in an enterprise environment, we recommend that you carefully consider your approach regarding the types of updates you're OK with.
